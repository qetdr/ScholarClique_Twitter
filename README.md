## Title 
Links between scholars' collaboration network properties, research output, and Twitter usage: a pilot study

## Content
The current repository includes the source code (as a Jupyter Notebook and a supplementary .py file) as well as the data set for main analyses and the project report.

All in all, the aim of this project was to investigate how a researcher's scientific output (e.g., number of publications, citations, etc) is associated with the properties of the researcher's collaboration network (number of communities, connected components, etc) as well as Twitter data (number of followers/followed users, tweets, likes, etc).

The present project is a pilot study, meaning that the main aim was to create a pipeline that allows for engineering further scalability but that can also present some preliminary findings. To that end, I believe that the project has succeeded to meet this goal.

The Jupyter Notebook file includes both the code necessary to deliver the output as well as a step-by-step guide regaring how to run the analyses, what are pre-requisites, etc. I believe that the notebook includes sufficient documentation and commentary to allow for a self-explanatory replication and development of the current project.
